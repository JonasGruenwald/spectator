# Spectator App

This is the code for a standalone application that runs spectator, intended to be used for inspecting other BEAM nodes in deployed / production-like environments.

The application is bundled as an escript and docker image.

For an overview of spectator itself, please see [the README](https://github.com/JonasGruenwald/spectator/blob/main/README.md).
